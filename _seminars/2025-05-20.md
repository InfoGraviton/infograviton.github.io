title: Introduction to the Covariant Phase Space method in General Relativity II
date: 2025-05-20
speaker: Maitá C. Micol
abstract: "In this seminar, we will continue the discussion on the covariant phase space (CPS) method, with concrete examples in scalar field theory, electromagnetism and general relativity. The goal of this talk is to develop the intuition behind this formalism and to give a nice application with the derivation of the first law of black hole thermodynamics."
