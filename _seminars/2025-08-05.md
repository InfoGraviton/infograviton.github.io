Throughout the last decade there has been a rising interest in the infrared structure of gravity and gauge theory. This was partially motivated by the unforeseen correspondences between many different results from the 1960s and 1970s—namely asymptotic symmetries, soft theorems, and memory effects—but has found many applications in theoretical high-energy physics, mathematical physics, and general relativity and gravitation. In this seminar (which is a preview for my qualifying exam), I will give an overview of all of these topics, with a particular interest toward the work I have been developing with Landulfo.
