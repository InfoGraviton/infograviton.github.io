title: The S Matrix Bootstrap
date: 2025-08-05
speaker: Níckolas de Aguiar Alves
abstract: "We generally expect quantum field theories to satisfy a few consistency constraints. Some examples may include locality, unitarity, causality, and certain suitable symmetries (such as Poincaré). Surprisingly, this small number of consistency considerations imposes extreme limitations on what is an acceptable quantum field theory. In this seminar, I will discuss these ideas in the context of the S matrix bootstrap as an introduction to modern amplitude methods in quantum field theory. As a practical example, I plan to derive the equivalence principle from field-theoretic considerations."
