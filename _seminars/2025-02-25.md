In this talk I will give a brief introduction and motivation for the covariant phase space (CPS) method. We will be interested in the application of this framework to the study of symmetries and conserved (corner!) charges in gauge theories, with a special focus on the diffeomorphism symmetry of General Relativity. We will start by reviewing the necessary mathematical background from symplectic geometry and discussing the relation between phase spaces in particle mechanics and the CPS method. We conclude by revisiting Wald's seminal paper on the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as a Noether charge, giving a new perspective on the first law of BH mechanics.
