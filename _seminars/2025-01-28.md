title: An Introduction to Linear Memory Effects
date: 2025-01-28
speaker: NÃ­ckolas de Aguiar Alves
abstract: "The memory effect is a simple, yet profound, prediction of general relativity and other field theories with massless propagating modes. Over the last decade, it has been noticed that it bears close connections to topics in the infrared structure of general relativity and gauge theory, and it is expected to be measured in future gravitational wave detectors. In this seminar, I provide a pedagogical introduction to linear memory in many theories of interest, ranging from the scalar wave equation to modified gravity."
