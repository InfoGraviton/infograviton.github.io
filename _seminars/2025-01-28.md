title: An Introduction to Linear Memory Effects
date: 2025-01-28
speaker: NÃ­ckolas de Aguiar Alves
abstract: "The memory effect is a simple, yet profound, prediction of general relativity. Over the last decade, it has been noticed that it bears close connections to topics in the infrared structure of general relativity and gauge theory, and it is expected to be measured in future gravitational wave detectors. In this work, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the linear memory effect in the scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational scenarios. The calculations illustrate the application of many methods of classical electrodynamics---such as the use of retarded potentials and multipole expansions---to a phenomenon still hardly found in modern textbooks in both electrodynamics or gravity."
