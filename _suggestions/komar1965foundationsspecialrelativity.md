The foundations of the special theory of relativity are examined in a new form which is more in keeping with the space-time symmetry of the resulting theory, and which employs those concepts which are most directly related to actual observation. The transformation group to which one is immediately led is the conformal mappings of the two-sphere, which, as is well known, is isomorphic to the homogeneous improper orthochronous Lorentz group. In order to obtain extensions to the Poincare group and/or the Einstein group of general relativity, additional assumptions are required.
