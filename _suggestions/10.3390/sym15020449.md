abstract: "Classical gravity is understood as the geometry of spacetime, and it seems very different from the other known interactions. In this review, I will instead stress the analogies: Like strong interactions, the low energy effective field theory of gravity is related to a nonlinearly realized symmetry, and like electroweak interactions, it is a gauge theory in Higgs phase, with a massive connection. I will also discuss the possibility of finding a UV complete quantum field theoretic description of all interactions."
