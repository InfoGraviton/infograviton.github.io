abstract: 'We prove the Penrose-Wall singularity theorem in the full semiclassical gravity regime, significantly expanding its range of validity. To accomplish this, we modify the definition of quantum-trapped surfaces without affecting their genericity. Our theorem excludes controlled "bounces" in the interior of a black hole and in a large class of cosmologies.'
