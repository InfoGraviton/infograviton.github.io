This lecture will discuss some of the peculiar properties of the metric 
\\[\\mathrm{d}s^2 = (t^2+l^2)(\\mathrm{d}\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta\\mathrm{d}\\phi^2) + U(t) (2l)^2 (\\mathrm{d}\\psi + \\cos\\theta \\mathrm{d}\\phi)^2 + 2 (2l)^2 (\\mathrm{d}\\psi + \\cos\\theta \\mathrm{d}\\phi) \\mathrm{d}t \\]
where
\\[ U(t) = - 1 + 2 (m t + l^2)/(t^2 + l^2) .\\]
This metric satisfies the empty-space Einstein equations
\\[ R_{\mu\nu} = 0 \\]
and has been discovered by both of the prime exact-solution-finding methods mentioned by Sachs in his paper in these Lectures. Taub discovered it in a systematic development of a class of metrics with high symmetry. Later is was rediscovered by Newman, Tamburino and Unti studying a class of algebraically special metrics. Actually, Taub gave the metric in a coordinate system convering only the region where \\(U(t) > 0\\) ("Taub space") in which the \\(t = \\text{const}\\) hypersurfaces are space-like, while Newman, Unti and Tamburino gave the region where \\(U(t) < 0\\) ("NUT space") in which the \\(\\psi\\)-lines (\\(t\\theta\\phi\\) constant) are time-like.
