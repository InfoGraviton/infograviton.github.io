abstract: "In this work, we study the decoherence of a quantum spatial superposition of a massive body created by an observer, Alice, that is subject to a short burst of gravitational radiation. We consider gravitational wave bursts with a simple oscillatory waveform and step-function memory waveform. Using a local description of the decoherence, we obtain an analytic estimate of the number of soft gravitons radiated by Alice's state. Moreover, we decompose her decoherence into contributions from the oscillatory and memory waveforms. We show that Alice's state decoheres proportional to the memory of the gravitational radiation she emits. To leading order, our calculation using a local description of the decoherence agrees with the decoherence caused by her radiating quadrupole. In general, the oscillatory contributions are strongly dependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work serves as a step towards understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity by demonstrating the role gravitational waves and the memory effect have in the loss of coherence of quantum superpositions. We also briefly investigate the electromagnetic analogue of this gedankenexperiment, in which Alice is subject to a burst of electromagnetic radiation, and discuss its correspondence to the gravitational case."
