The standard picture of the loop expansion associates a factor of $\\hbar$ with each loop, suggesting that the tree diagrams are to be associated with classical physics, while loop effects are quantum mechanical in nature. We discuss counterexamples wherein classical effects arise *from loop diagrams* and display the relationship between the classical terms and the long range effects of massless particles.
