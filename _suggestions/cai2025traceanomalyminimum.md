While the equation of state (EOS) $P(\\varepsilon)$ of neutron star (NS) matter has been extensively studied, the EOS-parameter $\\phi = P/\\varepsilon$ or equivalently the dimensionless trace anomaly $\\Delta = 1/3-\\phi$, which quantifies the balance between pressure $P$ and energy density $\\varepsilon$, remains far less explored, especially in NS cores. Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $\\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that $\\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\\phi$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $\\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $\\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.
