All modern wireless communication technologies are based on electromagnetism. However, electromagnetic signals are susceptible to screening and blocking, so their availability cannot be guaranteed in adverse environments. This raises a fundamental question: Can information be transmitted through a truly unblockable channel? Here we show that gravity, unlike electromagnetism, offers such a path. We propose and implement a wireless communication protocol in which a broadcaster encodes a binary message by moving a mass, while a receiver detects the resulting gravitational signal with a gravimeter. We validate this scheme experimentally, successfully transmitting a gravitational message a distance of   0.7 m through a brick wall at a rate of 1 bit min   . These results establish gravity as a viable platform for unblockable communication.
