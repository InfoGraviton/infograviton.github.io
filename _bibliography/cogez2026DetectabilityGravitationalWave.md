Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy opens a new venue to explore the universe. Future observatories such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are expected to observe previously undetectable fundamental physics effects in signals predicted by General Relativity (GR).One particularly interesting such signal is associated to the displacement memory effect, which corresponds to a permanent deformation of spacetime due to the passage of gravitational radiation. In this work, we explore the ability of LISA to observe and characterize this effect. In order to do this, we use state-of-the-art simulations of the LISA instrument, and we perform a Bayesian analysis to assess the detectability and establish general conditions to claim detection of the displacement memory effect from individual massive black hole binary (MBHB) merger events in LISA. We perform parameter estimation both to explore the impact of the displacement memory effect and to reconstruct its amplitude. We discuss the precision at which such a reconstruction can be obtained thus opening the way to tests of GR and alternative theories. To provide astrophysical context, we apply our analysis to black hole binary populations models and estimate the rates at which the displacement memory effect could be observed within the LISA planned lifetime.
