We employ the isomonodromic method to study linear scalar massive perturbations of Kerr black holes for generic scalar masses $M\\mu$ and generic black hole spins $a/M$. We find that the longest-living quasinormal mode and the first overtone coincide for $(M \\mu)_c \\cong 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c \\cong 0.9994660$. We also show that the longest-living mode and the first overtone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around the point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric phase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a thermodynamic analogy.
